Spearz&#46;io is a simple web game and my first complete large scale project. After months of learning and hard work, I released it to the world in the summer of 2018.

The process of creating this game has taught me countless lessons about development and introduced me to the challenges of promoting your work. Spearz&#46;io reached 10,000+ players during its lifetime and developing it was an experience like no other. Now, I've moved on to other projects. Which is why...

## Spearz&#46;io is now open source!
Developing spearz was an amazing and challenging experience. Multiplayer networking was an especially tricky set of concepts to learn and implement. After releasing the game and having some fun promoting it, I've decided to make it open source in the hope that it will serve as a useful resource to anyone looking to develop their own web game. The game is no longer available online, but you can run this project and use something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to play with other people. It is incredibly useful to have a complete example of what goes in to a project like this and certainly a resource I wish I had access to while developing it. So dig around and learn some stuff! I found the [documentation on Valve's Source Engine](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking) and [Gabriel Gambetta's series on Fast-Paced Multiplayer](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) especially useful.

If you are in the process of building your own web game, I wish you the best of luck. If nothing else, you will learn an incredible amount and hopefully enjoy the experience. ðŸ˜„
